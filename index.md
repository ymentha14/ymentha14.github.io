<h1 align="middle"> Hello you! </h1>
Welcome to Fromage and Programming! This website aims at presenting some of the cool projects I could work on in the past years, along with some incredible cheeses I discovered. I hope that both of them will motivate you to explore more these two wonderful worlds, fromage and programming!
<h2 align="middle"> Sections </h2>
The **Projects** section shows you the projects I have done in a chronological order from bottom to top. The **Courses** gives you an exhaustive list of the courses I am attending and did attend. A few **Cheat Sheets** will appear as I complete these courses as well! And finally.. you'll check the **Fromages** section yourself ;)
