        <title>Network for Mouse Genetics</title>
        <description>
          
          Wikipedia describes the phenotype as the composite of the organism’s observable characteristics or traits. (…) An organism’s phenotype results from two basic factors: the expression of an organism’s genetic code, or its genotype, and the influence of environmental factors. Both factors may interact, further affecting phenotype. In fact, both the...

        <title>Data Awareness Dunnhumby dataset</title>
        <description>
          
          We proposed an in-depth analysis of the dunnhumby dataset: a file gathering information about consumer behaviors and demographic information for the dunnhumby company (an american supermarket chain) Since more than 90% of our data consisted of food items, we were naturally interested in scrapping the nutritional values for each item...

        <title>C++ Multithreaded Coencapsulation</title>
        <description>
          
          Introduction The goal of the project consisted in coencapsulating micro-beads of RNA primers with cells into a single drop of lysis buffer in order to allow sub-sequent RNA single cell sequencing.: this would allow to let the RNA of the cell binds to the bead, which could be further down...
