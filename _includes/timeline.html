    In order to put new knowledge into practice and gain my financial independence, I work under multiple positions as a part-time engineer, trying to discover as much to the researchðŸ”¬ sector as the industryðŸ’¼ one .

                    <p>
                        In order to gain practical experience in industry, I decided to perform an internship in an ML consulting company. During this time, I improved solutions for 3 client projects (major Swiss companies) in Natural Language processing and Time Series forecasting. I also built the building blocks of a backend software and prepared deliverables for the DevOps.
                        After excellent client feedbacks, I got offered to keep on working at Visium as a part-time ML engineer in parallel to my studies. The topics I worked on involve NLP, object detection and information retrieval.

                        This Master of Data Science allows me to develop skills of ML, Software Development, Statistics and Engineering. More generally, we approach both technically and practically ML-related challenges that we face in both in the industry and research sectors.

                        Great accademic results allowed me to attend the master of Data Science at EPFL, for which I still had to confirm credits in CSE. I took this opportunity to peform an exchange at ETH.

                        I worked on the development of a multithreaded C++ real-time image analysis software facilitating a deterministic cell-bead coencapsulation allowing subsequent single cell sequencing.
                        Thanks to encouraging results, I got hired as a research assistant in the same laboratory to pursue my research on the same topic.
