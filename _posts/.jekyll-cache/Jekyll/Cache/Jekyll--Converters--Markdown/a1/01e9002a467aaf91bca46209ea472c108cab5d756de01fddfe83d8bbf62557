I"œ<p>What is it with that Mary girl?  Dragging me to school every day. As if I had a choice.  What you donâ€™t hear in those nursery rhymes is that she starves me if I donâ€™t go to school with her; itâ€™s the only way I can stay alive!  Iâ€™m thinking about being adopted by Little Bo Peep, sure I may get lost, but anything is better than being with Mary and those little brats at school (shudder, shudder).</p>
