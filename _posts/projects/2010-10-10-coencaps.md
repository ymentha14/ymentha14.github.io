## Introduction
The goal of the project consisted in coencapsulation of micro-beads of RNA primers with cells into a single drop of lysis buffer using microships: both the cells and the beads would flow through channels A and B respectively.

Once coencapsulated, the lysis buffer dissolves the cell membrane, releasing the expressed RNA in the fluid and letting it bind to the RNA primers of the bead: this allows sub-sequent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_cell_sequencing">RNA single cell sequencing.</a>. 
<br>

I therefore had the opportunity to undertake a one-year internship in order to develop an object-oriented multithreaded library able to automate this coencapsulation process: a first version developped by the researchers of the lab already existed, but was making use of valves which in turn created a lot of turbulence in both channels, lowering thus the rate of successful coencapsulations. My goal consisted so in creating a valve-free version of this process, using flow pressures exclusively.
## Implementation
The challenge consisted thus in controlling the flows of the 2 channels (the bead channel and the cell channel) using the microscope camera and a computer driven flow micro-controller: the program had to be able to execute the following tasks:
<ul>
<li> Detect the arrival of an upcoming cell/bead in the microscope field of view </li>
<li> Stabilize the detected cell/bead in a predefined region by balancing pressures of both channels while keeping pushing flow in the empty channl untill the arrival of the second cell/bead. </li>
<li> Detect arrival of the second cell/bead, and synchronize both elements such that they end up in the merged channel at the same time. </li>
<li> In case multiple beads/cells appear simultaneously in the field of view, the program needs to keep track of all of them and handle pressures such that no coencapsulations are missed </li>
</ul>
Since the program had to be particularly reactive, concurrent programming was necessary. Python implementation showed poor responsiveness, C++ was thus preferred using object-oriented multithreaded code exclusively.<br>

In order to let the computer react appropriately to the multiple possible situations and to stabilize efficiently both the beads and the cells, a <strong> PID controller </strong> was used. The algorithm consisted of a <strong> finite-state automaton </strong> alternating between the following states:

 1. <b><font color="blue">EMPTY</font></b> _(the bead channel flushes fluid untill a bead is detected in the zone of interest)_
 2. <b><font color="blue">COMING</font></b>: _(the bead is stabilized by the PID, the cell channel flushes fluid untill a cell is detected in the ZOI_)
 3. <b><font color="blue">FLUSHING</font></b>: _(both channels flush simultaneously: a 3rd PID synchronizes the 2 channels in order to coencapsulate the 2 elements)_
 4. <b><font color="blue">RECOVERING</font></b>: _When 2 beads arrive  at the same time, the program needs to coencapsulate the first bead while keeping the second bead in the channel._
## Results
The program was able to perform bead-bead coencapsulation with an accuracy greater than 95% at a rate of more than 1000 coencapsulation per hour depending on the bead concentration.

## Retrospective improvements
The coencapsulation scheme would have be a very good practical case for some <strong> Reinforcement Learning </strong> that I did not know of about at that time. However, python implementation would still have been a bottleneck problem, C++ implentation of RL should be feasible though.
