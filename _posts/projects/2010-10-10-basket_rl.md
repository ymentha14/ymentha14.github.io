## Description
As my adventure in ML did not lead to Reinforcement Learning yet and that I was very curious about this topic, I decided to start a project of my own to get to know this field a bit better. When it comes to the application of RL, you can either decide to remain virtual (e.g. teach the program to play a video game) or go real, by giving it access to microcontrollers and perform application on analog signals/real world phenomenon. In 2020, toyota launched Cue4, a robot specialized at shooting basketball hoopsüèÄü§ñ:

As I remember the long hours spent as a kid training alone on the playground to improve my shoot, no need to say that the idea of a robot doing the same was quite exciting to me. Of course, I don't pretend performing as well as toyota, yet I really like the application. This is why I decided to attack a version, let's say, more accessible.

The final objective would consist of an arduino-based mini-robot able to shoot on a small basket and recover its own ball after the shot. An articulated arm would shoot the ball at a constant horizontal angle, the factor that shoot be tuned by RL would be the strength of the shot.

<i> On the long term, the robot would look like a funny mix of these two guys. </i>

 Of course, the project would present many challenges, among them here are the main ones:

<ul>
<li> Construction of the robot with (an embedded arduino hardware with various assembled components) </li>
<li> Recognition of the ball by computer vision techniques</li>
<li> Recognition of the basket and alignment with it wrt to the front camera </li>
<li> Shooting by RL </li>
</ul>

In a first step, I plan to train the RL architecture on a simulation of noisy shooting following ballistics rules, first in 2d, then in 3d. This phase would occur in parallel to my courses of this semester.

The super fun part would come this summer, when assembling the actual robot and fine-tuning it on real-world data. Ideally, one should be able to let it shoot in a circumferences with fences s.t. finding/recovering the ball is not a problem. This way, training could occur on an extensed period of time :) .
