## Description
<p>Torchlurk is a python library allowing you to easily visualize what your sequential CNN has learned by providing various feature such as <b>Grad-CAM, saliency maps</b> or <b>filter visualization</b> directly in a notebook or by serving it on a localport.</p>



## Personal Involvement
I was in charge of developping and maintaining the whole backend aspect of the project which involved the following challenges:
* Development of a pytorch pipeline for filter visualization (gradient descent on input features, gradCAM, saliency MAPS)
* Integration of a Flask API to serve the application locally
* Data Storage
* Integration of Jupyter-notebook compliant visualization features

But got implied in the frontend development as well:
* Javascript codebase for "Explore" section of the website
* HTML/CSS of the afformentionned website
* Video editing to advert for and present the tool.
