## Introduction
As part of the CS-433 master course of Machine Learning, an AI crowd competition took was organized for the students: the goal consisted in developing ourself the methods used such as KFold cross-validation, stochastic gradient descent, least square losses etc) <br>

The dataset is divided into a training and a testing set composed of 250’000 and 568’238 samples respectively and both having 30 features. The training set is paired with labels where each sample is associated to a category (−1 for background noise and 1 for the presence of a Higgs Boson).

## Implementation
As this was a low-level project to gain insights into the basic methods in ML, a simple self-implemented ridge regression allowed us pass the hard baseline for the competition.

## Retrospective Improvements
No particular improvements for this project.
