## Introduction

As a semester project, I chose the Emojis Dataset from Dlab. As emojis became a central part of digital communication in the last decades, being able to represent these emojis in an appropriate semantic space becomes a crucial aspect in Natural Language Processing to extract the meaning of a sentence. <br>

The project consisted of 2 phases: I first had to design the data pattern we needed to accurately describe emojis and gather this data. As the tools I needed to perform this task (Amazon Mturk and Google Appscript) were not easily synchronizable, I chose to develop a python package, [Mturk2gform](https://ymentha14.github.io/2010-10-10-mt2gf/). <br>


In a second phase, I performed semantic analysis of these emojis by embedding them in a feature space using the last attention layer of a pre-trained english BERT model. Performing t-sne dimension reduction allowed me to generate plot witnessing the coherence of the embedding.
