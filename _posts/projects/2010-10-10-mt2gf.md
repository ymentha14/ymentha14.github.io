## Introduction

During my semester project at [DLAB](https://dlab.epfl.ch/), I had to synchronize forms generation using Appscript and human labelling resources using amazon MTurk. As no tool allowed to effectively synchronize these two technologies, I implemented it myself and turned it into a pypi package readily available.

Mturk2Gform lets you easily link a set of generated Google forms to Amazon Mechanical Turk HITs, taking advantage of both frameworks benefits:

* The generative capability of Google Appscript to automate personalized Google forms creation.
* The robust features of Amazon MTurk to control task scheduling and workers payment.

Although MTurk already provides the user with forms to gather data, its features are somehow limited in comparison with what can be done in Google Forms, in particular when it comes to generate a big number of these forms. (image integration, easy linkage with other drive documents etc.)
