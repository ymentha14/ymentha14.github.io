<p>We proposed an in-depth analysis of the dunnhumby dataset: a file gathering information about consumer behaviors and demographic information for the dunnhumby company (an american supermarket chain) <br />
Since more than 90% of our data consisted of food items, we were naturally interested in scrapping the nutritional values for each item of our dataset, since these were not present. I personally developed the recursive algorithm associating any food article of our dataset to the semantically closest corresponding article in an equivalent database from the U.S department of agriculture which in turn did have nutritional values. <br /> For instance, the article “Fondue fromage gruyere” was to be associated with “art. 34 fondue moitié-moitié” rather than “Pizza fromage gruyere” since in the former case, the nutritional values would fit better.
The following parsing algorithm was therefore developed in order to analyze and associate the words of any article:</p>

<p>The challenge consisted mainly in defining a score metric for the item words, since some words describe “nutritionally” better the articles  than others (<em>for instance in “pizza olive and oil”, “pizza” turns out to be the most relevant word</em>). <br /></p>

<p>This preprocessing allowed me to perform further analysis, including an outlier estimation highlighting the households presenting potential risky consumption behaviors.
The rest of the project consisted in developing and maintaining the project blog that you can access in its totality on the following link:</p>
